/**
 * Definitions from file SDL_gamecontroller.h
 *
 * <p>Function definitions for SDL game controller event handling.</p>
 *
 * <p>In order to use these functions, SDL_Init() must have been called
 * with the {@link SdlSubSystemConst#SDL_INIT_GAMECONTROLLER SDL_INIT_GAMECONTROLLER} flag.
 * This causes SDL to scan the system
 * for game controllers, and load appropriate drivers.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you would like to receive controller updates while the application
 * is in the background, you should set the following hint before calling
 * SDL_Init(): SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_ALLOW_BACKGROUND_EVENTS</p>
 *
 * <p>To count the number of game controllers in the system for the following:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *  int nJoysticks = SDL_NumJoysticks();
 *  int nGameControllers = 0;
 *  for (int i = 0; i &lt; nJoysticks; i++) {
 *      if (SDL_IsGameController(i)) {
 *          nGameControllers++;
 *      }
 *  }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Using the SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG hint or the SDL_GameControllerAddMapping() you can add support for controllers SDL is unaware of or cause an existing controller to have a different binding. The format is:
 * guid,name,mappings</p>
 *
 * <p>Where GUID is the string value from SDL_JoystickGetGUIDString(), name is the human readable string for the device and mappings are controller mappings to joystick ones.
 * Under Windows there is a reserved GUID of "xinput" that covers any XInput devices.</p>
 *
 * <p>The mapping format for joystick is:</p>
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>bX - a joystick button, index X</li>
 *      <li>hX.Y - hat X with value Y</li>
 *      <li>aX - axis X of the joystick</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p>Buttons can be used as a controller axis and vice versa.</p>
 *
 *  <p>This string shows an example of a valid mapping for a controller</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * "03000000341a00003608000000000000,PS3 Controller,a:b1,b:b2,y:b3,x:b0,start:b9,guide:b12,back:b8,dpup:h0.1,dpleft:h0.8,dpdown:h0.4,dpright:h0.2,leftshoulder:b4,rightshoulder:b5,leftstick:b10,rightstick:b11,leftx:a0,lefty:a1,rightx:a2,righty:a3,lefttrigger:b6,righttrigger:b7",
