/**
 * An SDL_GUID is a 128-bit identifier for an input device that
 * identifies that device across runs of SDL programs on the same
 * platform. If the device is detached and then re-attached to a
 * different port, or if the base system is rebooted, the device
 * should still report the same GUID.
 *
 * <p>GUIDs are as precise as possible but are not guaranteed to
 * distinguish physically distinct but equivalent devices. For
 * example, two game controllers from the same vendor with the same
 * product ID and revision may have the same GUID.</p>
 *
 * <p>GUIDs may be platform-dependent (i.e., the same device may report
 * different GUIDs on different operating systems).</p>
